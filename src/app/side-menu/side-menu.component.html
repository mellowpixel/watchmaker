<h1>ABOUT<br>THE SHOW</h1>

<div class="block-of-text">
	<p>Blending classical ballet and street dance in a modern metropolis, this story presents an existential struggle with the illusion of time. ‘The Watchmaker’ presents the reality of people living in a busy modern city. Lost amidst the hustle and bustle of routine, precious moments of life slip by unappreciated.</p>
	<p>The main character is a watchmaker. He has an appreciation for all moments, leading a mindful and fulfilling life. He observes the people of the city and the lives that they lead. But suddenly the clock of the main square has been broken and evil spirits spread like a deadly virus throughout the city, trying to destroy peace and harmony. By means of dance we see family disputes, children neglected, self-criticism and addiction. The Watchmaker has a plan… But time is running out!</p>
	<p>The dance production touches upon a universal issue: that of happiness, of self-actualisation and well-being available to us every day. This ballet is unique in the way that it brings street dance into the theatre and gives it a central focus. The show unites professional dancers of various styles (classical ballet, modern dance, hiphop, popping, break dance, contemporary  and krump), and nationalities (Irish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Russian, Brazilian, Argentinian, French, Australian, Japanese, Philippinian, Indonesian, Moroccan, Spanish, Turkish, Polish and South African) in a wonderful performance.</p>
